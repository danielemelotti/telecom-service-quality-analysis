# Objective
The primary goal of this project is to analyze the service quality of *Atlas Communications*, a major telecommunications provider which has a monopoly on phone services in many areas of the US. The company claims that they take 7.6 minutes to repair phone services for its customers on average. We act as the New York *Public Utilities Commission* (PUC), which regularly monitors repair times with customers in New York to verify the quality of Atlas' services. Utilizing hypothesis testing and bootstrap methods, the project aims to verify the company's claim about their repair efficiency and provide a comprehensive understanding of the service quality as experienced by customers in New York.

# Dataset
The dataset consists of a recent sample of repair times collected by the New York PUC. It records the time taken by Atlas Communications to repair phone services for each customer in the sample.

# 1. Data Visualization and Hypothesis Formulation {#sec1}

We start off by loading the sample data and summarizing it:
```{r}
atlas <- read.csv(file = "../data/atlascom.csv")

str(atlas)
summary(atlas)
```

We know that we are dealing with a dataframe containing two variables:
* a _Time_ variable, which indicates the repair times,
* a _Group_ variable, which indicates the carrier type; it can be either CLEC or ILEC, but since Verizon is an ILEC, all the entries correspond to ILEC indeed (see [this link](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/difference-between-ilec-and-clec) for differences between CLEC and ILEC).

There are 1664 data entries, the mean value is 8.412 minutes, while the median time is 3.59 minutes.
